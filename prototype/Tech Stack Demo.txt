The reason why we chose node.js for our main applicatoin is that the code runs quickly, and that enhances the entire run-time environment especially the limiation over the hardwares. Furthermore, the flexibitlity of Node.js is also beneficial for our project developement, which we would need to fix tons of source code provided by open-sources APIs and node.js made it possibe to do so. We also utilize mySQL as our backend database since we would not have too many complicate user data(currently, its only the user name & user photo). Thus a relational database such as mySQL is pretty handy for the purpose of managing our user data.
