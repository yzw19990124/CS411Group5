    <!-- about this project (group members, short description of functions...) -->
    <p>By simply uploading an image of your face, you can get a Spotify playlist aligned with your exact mood.</p>

    <p id='pblu'>**How does this work?**</p>
    <p>This application uses facial recognition software to analyse the inputted image and rates its emotion on a scale. Then this emotion is used with Spotify's database to construct the ideal playlist.</p>
